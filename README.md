**Technologies Used:** Next.js, PostgresSQL, GraphQL, Google Places, Leaflet, Chart.js

OrniTwo is a full stack birdwatching web app deployed on Vercel. It allows quick tracking of bird sightings for ornithologists, whether full-time or hobbyists.

The app was built using Next.js, PostgresSQL, and GraphQL. It leverages Google Places, Leaflet, and Chart.js for data visualization.

Users can explore information about birds and other Ornitwo users. They can also report bird sightings after registering or logging in securely. The reporting feature includes a Google Places location check and ensures up-to-date reports within three days.

The app analyzes user sightings, presenting bird rankings, active user charts, and random bird displays to encourage bird diversity exploration. Bird profiles include accurate drawings, chronologically ordered lists, average appearances through Chart.js visualizations, and maps with bird pin locations based on reported sightings.

User profiles enable owners to manage their sightings, including deletion.

Ornitwo prioritizes mobile use, offering a responsive layout for larger screens.
